                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Founded in the year of the great water whisper, SALWACO emerged from the bubbling springs of
                        innovation and the echoing
                        calls of thirsty townsfolk. With pipes forged from moonlight and valves tuned to the rhythm
                        of
                        the rainforest, the
                        company began its journey to hydrate the heart of Sierra Leone. Over the decades, it has
                        grown
                        from a humble puddle to a
                        mighty river of service and sustainability.
